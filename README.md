# UCh ECS 
Entity Component System framework for Unity 3D inspired by [Ash](http://www.richardlord.net/ash/) and [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) frameworks.

## Overview

UCh ECS allows to create systems to process entities that contain a set of defined components using game object as a entity id. The design behind UCh ECS is based in this principles:

- Avoid creating a parallel entity concepts. In UChECS there is a 1-1 relation between game object and entity.
- Reduction of boilerplate is a high priority. The framework provide helper classes to help you focus in game design, not glue code.
- Components can be anything. Just create data classes and register them, no need of inheritance.
